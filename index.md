I am an aspiring research student in astrophysics with a background in observational and computational astronomy. My research interests span exoplanet studies, galaxy evolution, and AGN feedback, with a particular focus on data analysis and simulation-based investigations.

I have gained hands-on experience in radio astronomy and hyperspectral imaging data analysis. Additionally, I have used artificial neural networks for redshift estimation of galaxies as a part of my bachelor's project.

Beyond research, I have contributed to the field through conference presentations, published work, and outreach activities. I enjoy sharing scientific knowledge and have given public talks.

I am eager to collaborate on projects related to astronomical data science, observational astronomy, and machine learning applications in astrophysics.
